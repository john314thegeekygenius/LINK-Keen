# Mutli-link
To play multiplayer, you need a link cable.
Player 1 (aka the gameboy connected to the purple connecter) MUST start the match.
You can set the number of players in the Game Settings menu, but it will automatically be set to the detected number of GBAs connected.

# Multi-boot
I'd like to get this working, but I can't find any documentation on it. If you found this and you know how to send ROMs to GBAs, please get in touch with me.
